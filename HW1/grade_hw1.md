### Overall Grade: 96/100

### Quality of report: 10/10

-   Is the homework submitted (git tag time) before deadline? 

-   Is the final report in a human readable format html? 

-   Is the report prepared as a dynamic document (R markdown) for better reproducibility?

-   Is the report clear (whole sentences, typos, grammar)? Do readers have a clear idea what's going on and how are results produced by just reading the report? 

### Completeness, correctness and efficiency of solution: 49/50

- Q1 (10/10)

- Q2 (17/20)

Files are gzipped, need `zcat` to display actual number of lines for the looping question (2.4). -3pt


- Q3 (12/10)

- Q4 (10/10)
	    
### Usage of Git: 7/10

-   Are branches (`master` and `develop`) correctly set up? Is the hw submission put into the `master` branch? **HW was not in main branch for original submission**.

-   Are there enough commits? Are commit messages clear? 
          
-   Is the hw1 submission tagged? 

-   Are the folders (`hw1`, `hw2`, ...) created correctly? 
  
-  **Do not put a lot auxiliary files into version control.**  `test1.txt, test2.txt` shouldn't be commited to github.

-   If those gz data files or `pride_and_prejudice.txt` are in Git, take 5 points off.

### Reproducibility: 10/10

-   Are the materials (files and instructions) submitted to the `master` branch sufficient for reproducing all the results? Just click the `knit` button will produce the final `html` on teaching server? 

-   If necessary, are there clear instructions, either in report or in a separate file, how to reproduce the results?
